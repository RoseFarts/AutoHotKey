# WoW AHK Scripts
### by Rezel / Hadronox
<br/>
This is a collection of AutoHotKey macro scripts which I wrote for World of Warcraft.<br/>
These AHK scripts are legitimate to use as they observe Blizzard's golden rule of "1 click, 1 action".<br/>
They are designed to work with GSE, Gnome Sequencer Enhanced, a legitimate WoW addon for custom skill castsequences.<br/>
However, with a bit of editing, these AHK macros can also be used for other applications or games.

3. Read the instructions provided with each macro to learn how it works.
4. Double-click the new AHK macro to activate it.
