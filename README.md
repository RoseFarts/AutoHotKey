# WoW AHK Scripts
### by Rezel / Hadronox
<br/>
This is a collection of AutoHotKey macro scripts which I wrote for World of Warcraft.\
These AHK scripts are legitimate to use as they observe Blizzard's golden rule of "1 click, 1 action".\
They are designed to work with GSE, Gnome Sequencer Enhanced, a legitimate WoW addon for custom skill castsequences.\
With a bit of editing, these AHK macros can be used for any number of other applications or games.
<br/><br/>

To use these AHK macro scripts:
1. Download and install AHK. (https://autohotkey.com/download/).
2. Download the AHK macro from the link provided. Alternatively, you can copy/paste the script into an empty text file, then rename its extension from `.txt` to `ahk`.
3. Read the instructions provided with each macro to learn how it works.
4. Double-click the new macro to activate it.
